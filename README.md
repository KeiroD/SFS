# SFS
A StopForumSpam port to ElkArte. As this is the dev branch, we will be working on SFS code here and once we're at a stable state, we will make a Release in the Master branch.

## The Original Branch
Any attempts to do a `PR` to the Original branch will be expressly rejected. Its purpose is to archive the [SimpleMachinesForum Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1519).

## Contributing:

* Troubleshoot issues you run into on the [ElkAte Community Forum](http://www.elkarte.net/community/index.php?topic=3183.0) so others can help & the developers (that is, me!) can reference it later.
* File detailed issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/Keiro/SFS/issues) e.g., what you did, and what the actual vs expected outcomes are.
* Read the [Developer's Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/elkarte/Elkarte/blob/master/DCO.txt) if you want to send us code. It means you acknowledge that you can and do license your submissions under the license of the project.
* Feel free to fork this repository and make your desired changes.

Please see our [How to contribute](https://github.com/KeiroD/SFS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) section for more information on how to contribute to the SFS Elkarte Port Project.

*Retain the entire Simple Machines copyright and licensing notice in every file.

*Make clear that the changed product is not the same as the original Simple Machines software (SMF or any other product).
